This project is a command-line interface (CLI) for the Cromwell Server, designed with the following objectives:

- Simplify the process of installing and configuring a local backend for the Cromwell Server using Docker.
- Enable reuse of already processed jobs via the Call Cache mechanism, set by default.
- Provide an interface for interacting with the server, such as submitting, querying, and inspecting jobs.
- Serve as a personal learning experience with the Go language.

The Broad Institute has its own [CLI for Cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromshell), which is worth checking out.

However, if you found our project helpful, don't forget to give us a star ðŸ˜‰.

## Quickstart

You can download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/lmtani/pumbaa/releases) for your platform or install it by running the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmtani/pumbaa/main/assets/install.sh | bash
```

You can install the binary in any location by setting the _PREFIX_ variable to your desired installation directory when running the script:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmtani/pumbaa/main/assets/install.sh | PREFIX=/home/taniguti/bin bash
```

This way you don't need to provide privileged access.

## Features

## Examples

_Obs:_ the examples below are from a previous release, but the commands are the same. I will update them soon.

### Local server deploy

You need to open a new terminal after starting the server. Press CTRL+c when you want to shut it down.

### Cromwell behind Google Identity Aware Proxy

This is a very specific use case, but it's here. If you are using a Cromwell server behind Google Identity Aware Proxy (IAP), you can use the `--iap` flag to make requests to it. You will need to provide the expected audience of the token, which is the client_id of your oauth. For example:

You will also need to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your Google service account JSON file.

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/google/service-account.json
HOST="https://your-cromwell.dev"
AUDIENCE="Expected audience"
pumbaa --host "${HOST}" --iap "${AUDIENCE}" query
```
