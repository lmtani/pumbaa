This program was created to:

- Facilitate the installation and configuration of a Cromwell Server with a local backend using Docker.
- Provide the functionality to reuse already processed jobs by default, via the Call Cache mechanism.
- Provide ways to interact with the server, such as submitting, querying, and inspecting jobs.
- Familiarize myself with the Go language.

The [Broad Institute has its own CLI](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromshell), be sure to check it out.

But don't forget to give us a star if ours has been helpful ðŸ˜‰
